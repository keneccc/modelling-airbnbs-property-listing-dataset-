Milestones 1 & 2 

Cleaned csv tabular data table 
Converted CSV data to pandas data framed. Cleaned Tabular data by removing all Nan values from all relevant clomuns 

Clenaed images data 
Using os to access the images folder then resizing every image and saved new edited images in new processed images folder. 

Milestones 3 & 4 


Cleaned csv dtabular data that has been converted to pandas data frame was split into feattures and labels. It was also further cleaned with the dataframe containing only numerical data.

Features and Labels are split into training, test and validation sets of data. All features where then normalised using Scaler from sklearn preprocessing.

the following model's hyperparamenters where tuned with the root mean squared error perfomance metric used to evalute the best models(Models, hyperparameters and perfomance metrics were saved in json and joblib files):
DecisionTreeRegressor
RandomForestRegressor
GradientBoostingRegressor & SGDregressor.

All models could be further fine tuned with better hyperparameters and or stacking and blending to improve accuracy. 
Based on the perfomance metrics the Gradient Boosting Regressor was used for predictions
