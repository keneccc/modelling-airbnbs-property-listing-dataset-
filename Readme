Milestones 1 & 2 

Cleaned csv tabular data table 
Converted CSV data to pandas data framed. Cleaned Tabular data by removing all Nan values from all relevant clomuns 

Clenaed images data 
Using os to access the images folder then resizing every image and saved new edited images in new processed images folder. 

Code for images: 
  class prepare_image():

        def download_images(self):


            image_folder = "images/"
            processed_images_folder="processed_images/"


            for root,dir,files in os.walk(image_folder):
                for file in files:
                    
                
                    filepath = os.path.join(root,file) 

                    img = Image.open(filepath)
                    

                    width, height = img.size
                    new_height = 500
                    new_width = 500


                    resized_img = img.resize((new_width, new_height))


                    target_location = os.path.join(processed_images_folder,dir[0])
                    if not os.path.exists( target_location ):
                        os.makedirs(target_location)
                        resized_img.save(target_location + file +"_processed.png")
